Steps to run the experiment 
------------
1. Download the processed LIDC_IDRI Version 2 data used in this project from: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/DOI/Standardized+representation+of+the+TCIA+LIDC-IDRI+annotations+using+DICOM

2. Run the following command with your conda environment activated: 
```
conda env update --file environment.yml
```
<b>[Optional]</b> If you want to create a new conda environment from yml file run this instead: 
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

3. Run: 
```
python prepare_images.py <IMAGE_PATH>
``` 

4. Go through the notebook: [1.0-classification.ipynb](https://github.com/MMIV-ML/Lung-CT-fastai-2020/blob/master/notebooks/1.0-classification.ipynb).

<b>[Note]</b> If conda environment is not showing up in Jupyter Notebook run the following lines:
```
conda activate lung-ct 
conda install jupyter nb_conda nb_conda_kernels ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name lung-ct --display-name "Python (lung-ct)"
```
